# Unity-Template
_A template repo for Unity projects._

**Includes:** 

1. Default `.gitignore` for Unity Projects
2. `.gitattributes` file for _git lfs_ from [alexkaratarakis](https://github.com/alexkaratarakis/gitattributes/blob/master/Unity.gitattributes) 
3. [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)



## Getting Started...

1. Use this template to create a new repository
2. Clone your new repo to your local machine
3. Open your cloned repo in the **Command Line** or **Git Bash**
4. Run the command `git lfs install`. After running the command, you should see a message that says _Git LFS initialized_

At this point you can either move your entire Unity project to the cloned repo, or create a new Unity Project in your cloned repo.


# IMPORTANT NOTE
**Your Unity project _must be on the same folder level as the `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files_. Failing to do so will cause unintended tracking and will more than likely attempt to commit _all_ of your changes since the `.gitignore` file will not be obeyed.**

# HOW TO PLAY
Move left and right with A and D, crouch with S. Get through the obstacles and you win.
